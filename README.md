- 👋 Hi, I’m Guillermo del Valle Reboul
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Deep Reinforcement Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Vision, such as CNN/RNN and YOLO, and Deep RL algorithms, such as value-based methods (Deep Q network), and policy-based methods like Actor-Critic and PPO among others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Deep Learning projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: my gmail address is guillermo.delvalle.reboul@gmail.com
